            <h3>Hi There!</h3>
            <h4>Who?<h4> 
            <p> 
                Hi! My name is Bailey and I am currently a junior at Seattle University. I was born on the
                beautiful island of Oahu, Hawaii where I grew up most of my life, but I have also lived in the 
                Bay Area. My hobbies include sports, photography, video making, listening to music, 
                and I love learning new things. 
            </p>
            <h4>What?</h4>
            <p>
                As mentioned earlier, I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science and striving
                towards a career in software development. 
            </p> 
            <h4>Why?</h4> 
            <p>
                I think that living in the Bay Area for a part of my life sort of acclimated me to a more 
                fast-paced and technology-driven environment than I was used to in Hawaii, which started 
                my interest in technology. As I got older, my interests started to focus more on computers 
                and how they work. 
        </p>
